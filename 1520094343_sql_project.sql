/* Welcome to the SQL mini project. For this project, you will use
Springboard' online SQL platform, which you can log into through the
following link:

https://sql.springboard.com/
Username: student
Password: learn_sql@springboard

The data you need is in the "country_club" database. This database
contains 3 tables:
    i) the "Bookings" table,
    ii) the "Facilities" table, and
    iii) the "Members" table.

Note that, if you need to, you can also download these tables locally.

In the mini project, you'll be asked a series of questions. You can
solve them using the platform, but for the final deliverable,
paste the code for each solution into this script, and upload it
to your GitHub.

Before starting with the questions, feel free to take your time,
exploring the data, and getting acquainted with the 3 tables. */
